Code:


class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if num <= 0:  # if number is negative or 0 there is no prime factors
            return False
            
        test = [2,3,5]  # Now we will check if the number is divisible by these prime numbers or not.
        
        for items in test:
            while num % items == 0:
                num = num // items
       
        if num == 1:   # if at least we get num == 1 it means that the number is completely divisible by theses prime numbers.
            return True
        else:
            return False
